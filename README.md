# Week 4: Spatial Databases

This week we move on to databases, in particular Postgres (aka Postgres). It is arguably the most powerful and versatile database available and knowing how to use it is almost certain to come in handy for anyone who works with data in their professional life.

Unfortuately, Postgres can be fussy to set up. So in preparation for this week's class, please follow the instructions in the "week-4-postgis-setup.pptx" to go through the setup and installation and make sure everything is working properly. If it goes smoothly, it should only take a few minutes.

If you do run into problems setting up Postgres, please be sure to let me know.
